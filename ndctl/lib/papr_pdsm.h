/*
 * PDSM Envelope:
 *
 * The ioctl ND_CMD_CALL transfers data between user-space and kernel via
 * envelope which consists of a header and user-defined payload sections.
 * The header is described by 'struct nd_pdsm_cmd_pkg' which expects a
 * payload following it and accessible via 'nd_pdsm_cmd_pkg.payload' field.
 * There is reserved field that can used to introduce new fields to the
 * structure in future. It also tries to ensure that 'nd_pdsm_cmd_pkg.payload'
 * lies at a 8-byte boundary.
 *

 *  |   64-Bytes  |       8-Bytes       |       Max 184-Bytes       |

 *
 * PDSM Header:
 *
 * The header is defined as 'struct nd_pdsm_cmd_pkg' which embeds a
 * 'struct nd_cmd_pkg' instance. The PDSM command is assigned to member
 * 'nd_cmd_pkg.nd_command'. Apart from size information of the envelope which is
 * contained in 'struct nd_cmd_pkg', the header also has members following
 * members:
 *
 * 'cmd_status'		: (Out) Errors if any encountered while servicing PDSM.
 * 'reserved'		: Not used, reserved for future and should be set to 0.
 *
 * PDSM Payload:
 *
 * The layout of the PDSM Payload is defined by various structs shared between
 * papr_scm and libndctl so that contents of payload can be interpreted. During
 * servicing of a PDSM the papr_scm module will read input args from the payload
 * field by casting its contents to an appropriate struct pointer based on the
 * PDSM command. Similarly the output of servicing the PDSM command will be
 * copied to the payload field using the same struct.
 *
 * 'libnvdimm' enforces a hard limit of 256 bytes on the envelope size, which
 * leaves around 184 bytes for the envelope payload (ignoring any padding that
 * the compiler may silently introduce).
